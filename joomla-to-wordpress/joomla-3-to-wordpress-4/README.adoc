This cookbook migrates data from a Joomla database into a Wordpress database.

== Which data will be migrated? ==

The cookbook maps the following data between the two systems:

* users
* articles, pages
* comments

== Tested versions ==

This cookbook was tested with the following versions.

*Joomla*

* 3.4.3

*Wordpress*

* 4.2.2
* 4.3

== Adapt the cookbook ==

You can adapt specific settings of the cookbook. These settings should be
managed by using the Mapping Editor of the Tensei-Data frontend.

== Before the migration ==

Some `tables` of the Wordpress database must be empty to avoid key errors during
the migration process.
